    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Rho Tau Gamma (RTG) Fraternity was founded on December 4, 1960, at Luzonian Colleges,
        now known as Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation (MSEUF), in the Philippines.
        Established by a group of students committed to intellectual growth and principled leadership,
        the fraternity was formed as an honor-oriented brotherhood guided by ideals of right thinking,
        truth, and faith.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
        During the early 1960s, student organizations played a significant role in campus life at Luzonian Colleges.
        A group of students envisioned forming a new fraternity that would promote academic excellence,
        ethical leadership, and constructive competition within the university community.
        This vision laid the foundation for what would become Rho Tau Gamma.
    </p>

    <h2>The Founding – December 4, 1960</h2>
    <p>
        The first formal meeting of the fraternity took place on December 4, 1960, at the Antigua Restaurant.
        Approximately twenty students attended the gathering to discuss the establishment of a new organization.
        Among the founding members were Ruperto Zarsuelo, Roman Mendioro, Rolando Ramos,
        Eutiquio Telada, Joseph Tan Palanca, Anselmo Regis, Conrado Sio, and
        Esmeraldo Palomar, then editor-in-chief of <em>The Luzonian</em>, the college publication.
    </p>

    <h2>Origin of the Name</h2>
    <p>
        The name “Rho Tau Gamma” was adopted to symbolize the fraternity’s guiding philosophy.
        Interpreted as “Right Thinkers Group,” the name reflects the founders’ emphasis on intellectual discipline,
        moral responsibility, and faith. The fraternity’s principles are traditionally associated with
        the values of Right, Truth, and God.
    </p>

    <h2>Drafting of the Constitution</h2>
    <p>
        During the founding meeting, Roman Mendioro and Ruperto Zarsuelo presented a draft constitution
        to guide the structure and governance of the organization. Esmeraldo Palomar was tasked
        with preparing the written document, incorporating revisions and suggestions from the founding members.
        The constitution outlined the fraternity’s objectives, membership standards, and leadership structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Institutional Recognition</h2>
